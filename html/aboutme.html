                <h5 class="gridMainSubTitle">After College: </h5>
                <p class="mainText">It wasn't until after college that I realized my professional interests were strictly tied to computers.  I had already spent a lot of money on an education that I probably wasn't going to use much.
                    The one unintended silver lining to earning a degree in History was I read a lot and I practiced reading a lot.  This comes in handy when learning about computers as tech books are long and dry.
                    I got heavily in to system administration project management before doing anything with code.  It wasn't until 2016 when I got to write some SQL code for the first time that I realized
                    I enjoyed coding and I wanted to learn more about it.  I've come to understand nobody is going to teach you, and you can waste a lot of time trying to find a job where you will learn on the fly.
                    Ultimately I decided to start this blog as a vehicle I could use to teach myself things like Javascript, PHP, and whatever else I feel like reading about in the future.
